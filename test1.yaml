execution_control:
  start_condition: "traffic_light == green"
  end_condition: "both vehicles reach speed limit or red light, whichever comes first"

validation_criteria:
  success:
    - "Both vehicles reach 50% of the speed limit within 10 seconds of green light"
    - "No red light violation by either vehicle"
  failure:
    - "Any vehicle violates traffic light signal"
    - "Any vehicle does not reach expected acceleration within the given time frame"
